### Whack-a-Mole
My First Project

This program was written as a JavaScript coding challenge, according to the following specifications:
- When your program starts up it must display the image that will move around, a Start button, a Stop button, and a way for the user to specify an interval before a new game begins. The default interval must be 1000 msec.
- When the user presses Start, a new game starts and the selected image is displayed at a random place.
- The image must move to a new random place once per interval.
- If the user presses the Stop button, the image must stop moving, and a subsequent Start must start everything over from the beginning.
- Each time the user successfully hits the image, the program must move the image to a new random place immediately (i.e., not wait for the current interval to end).
- When the user has hit the image 3 times, the program must display a confirm dialog box that reports the elapsed time and that also says something like "Another game?" If the user pushes OK, that starts a new game immediately (no need to push Start again). If Cancel is pushed, the program stops.
